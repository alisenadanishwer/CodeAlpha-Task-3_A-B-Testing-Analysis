# A/B Testing Analysis: Data Generation, Statistical Analysis, and Visualization

## üìã Overview

This repository shows a comprehensive A/B testing workflow using Python, covering three core aspects

1. **Data Generation and Statistical Analysis**
2. **Basic Visualizations**
3. **Advanced Visualizations and Insights**

The code simulates an A/B testing experiment and walks through the entire process from data generation to statistical analysis and meaningful visualizations to extract actionable insights.

## ‚ú® Features

### Section 1: Data Generation and Statistical Analysis
- Simulates user conversions for two test groups (`Group A` and `Group B`) with specified conversion rates.
- Calculates key statistical metrics like mean conversion rates and standard deviations for both groups.
- Performs a two-sample t-test to check if there is a significant difference between the groups.

### Section 2: Basic Visualizations
- **Histogram of Conversions**: Visualizes the distribution of conversions in each group.
- **Box Plot**: Displays the spread and central tendency of conversion rates.
- **Bar Plot with Error Bars**: Shows conversion rates with error bars to indicate variability.

### Section 3: Advanced Visualizations and Insights
- **Cumulative Conversion Rate**: Visualizes how conversion rates evolve as more data is collected.
- **Pie Charts of Conversion Outcomes**: Illustrates the proportion of converted vs. non-converted users in each group.
- Provides additional insights and a summary of findings, highlighting whether there is a statistically significant difference between the test groups.

## üìä Visualizations

1. **Histograms**: Distribution of conversions for Group A and Group B.
2. **Box Plots**: Helps compare the median and quartile ranges of conversions between the groups.
3. **Bar Plots**: Visual representation of conversion rates with error bars indicating standard error.
4. **Cumulative Conversion Rate Plots**: Tracks the cumulative conversion rates over trials.
5. **Pie Charts**: Depicts the ratio of conversions and non-conversions for both groups.

## üõ†Ô∏è Dependencies

The code requires the following libraries:

- `numpy`: For data simulation and manipulation.
- `pandas`: For data structuring and analysis.
- `scipy`: For statistical testing.
- `matplotlib` and `seaborn`: For creating visualizations.

Install the dependencies using:

```bash
pip install numpy pandas scipy matplotlib seaborn
```

## üöÄ How to Run the Code

1. Install the dependencies:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```
3. Run the code:
   - You can run the entire code in a Jupyter Notebook or a Python IDE.
   - Ensure that all required libraries are installed.

## üìà Interpretation and Insights

- If the p-value from the t-test is less than the significance level (Œ± = 0.05), there is a statistically significant difference between Group A and Group B.
- Visualizations such as histograms, box plots, and cumulative plots help interpret how the groups perform over time and provide a clear picture of their conversion trends.

## üîç Key Takeaways

- This project serves as a template for conducting A/B testing analysis and visualization.
- It helps analyze conversion data, perform hypothesis testing, and visualize results, making it a useful guide for data scientists and analysts looking to gain insights from A/B testing experiments.

## üí° Future Enhancements

- Add confidence intervals for conversion rates to provide better uncertainty estimation.
- Implement other statistical tests, such as Chi-square, for categorical data.
- Integrate more complex visualizations like ROC curves or gain charts for binary classification metrics.

Feel free to explore the code, suggest improvements, and share your thoughts! üéâ
